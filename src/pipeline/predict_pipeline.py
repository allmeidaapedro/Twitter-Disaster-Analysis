class PredictPipeline:
    '''
    Class for making predictions using a trained model and preprocessor.

    This class provides a pipeline for making predictions on new instances using a trained machine learning model and
    a preprocessor. It loads the model and preprocessor from files, preprocesses the input features, and estimates the probability of a tweet being related to a disaster.

    Methods:
        predict(features):
            Make predictions on new instances using the loaded model and preprocessor.

    Example:
        pipeline = PredictPipeline()
        new_features = [...]
        prediction = pipeline.predict(new_features)

    Note:
        This class assumes the availability of the load_object function.

    Class for handling input data for predictions.
